# CMI---Problematic-Internet-Usage
In this project, our aim was to predict the sii (a measure related to problematic internet use) by using time series and static data. We implemented this through effective feature engineering, comprehensive data preprocessing and used several machine learning models and achieved a high predictive accuracy.
